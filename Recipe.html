     <p>If you'd like to learn how to bake bread, here's a wonderful place to start. <br> This easy white bread recipe bakes up deliciously golden brown. <br> There's nothing like the homemade aroma wafting through my kitchen as it bakes. 
          </p>
     <p> Ingredients Quantity </p>
           <p> Steps : </p>
             <ul>
               <li> 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast </li>
             <li>2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°) </li>
             <li> 3  tablespoons sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar. </li>
             <li> 1 tablespoon salt. </li>
            <li> 2.  tablespoons canola oil </li>
                <li> 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups bread flour        
         </li>
       </ul>
     <p>Directions </p>
       <p>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; <br>let stand until bubbles form on surface. <br>Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 3 cups flour. <br>Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth. <br>Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.
    </p>
    <p> Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. <br> Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. <br>Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
      </p>
   <p> Punch dough down. <br>Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. <br>Shape each into a loaf. Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. <br> loaf pans. <br>Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
     </p>
   <p> Bake at 375° until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or<br> has reached an internal temperature of 200°, 30-35 minutes. <br>Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
     </p>
   <p> Test Kitchen Tips </p>

 <p> Be careful that your water isn't too hot when proofing yeast.
